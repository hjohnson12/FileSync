# FileSync - Windows Forms

A basic application made with C# and Windows forms that syncs the contents from the source directory to the destination directory
using a file system watcher. Able to move the contents from the source directory or delete the source directory. 

Made as part of a final project in *Fall 2016* for an introduction t dkestop app development class:

  * **NOTE:** Since this application was made for an intro class, it's recommended to run file sync on small directories.

Other projects created for the final include (all created with C# Windows Forms):

* Simple login program using a SQL local database with Visual Studio. The solution contains each one of the other 3 projects created for the final as a separate form once the user logs in.

* Basic application that connects to a ftp server and does simple operations such as read contents in a directory, upload a file,
and delete a file.
